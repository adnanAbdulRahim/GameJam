Root Runner is a 2D platformer game that takes place entirely underground, with a main theme centred around roots. The player takes on the role of a character navigating through a network of roots and obstacles. The roots serve as both the environment and the main challenge of the game, as the player must dodge, jump over, or find a way around them in order to progress. The game's unique setting and use of roots as obstacles make it stand out from other platformers and provide a fresh and challenging gaming experience. Additionally, being developed by five students for Global Game Jam is a remarkable accomplishment, as it showcases their creativity and ability to work together as a team under tight deadlines and for the first time using Unity Engine.
